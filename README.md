# code-refactor-challenge
This is a basic html reformatting attempt, The page visuals were not changed but rather the order and semantic elements were either created or relabeled and grouped properly. Going from top to bottom all the elements are ordered accordingly. There were a number of adjustments made to the css styling document to make sure all the visuals are up to par with the user request requiring that the appearance doesn't change but rather the organization of the HTML document.
